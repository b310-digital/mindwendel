# Installing and Running mindwendel

We have prepared different installation configurations for you. A postgres database server is the only external dependency needed by mindwendel in order to store all application data.

Below, we provide detailed instructions on how to install and run mindwendel in a variety of common configurations:

- [Running on Docker-Compose](#running-on-docker-compose) (RECOMMENDED)
- [Running on Docker](#running-on-docker)

## Running on Docker-Compose

When you use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you will be using one or several `docker-compose.yml` files.

- Add the following snippets to one of your `docker-compose.yml` file

  ```yml
  services:
    # You might already have other docker services listed in your docker-compose file
    # ...

    # Add the following mindwendel service
    mindwendel:
      image: ghcr.io/mindwendel/mindwendel:latest
      environment:
        # Add the address of the database host, so that mindwendel can find the database, e.g. an ip address or a reference to another service in the docker-compose file
        DATABASE_HOST: db

        # Add the port of the database host (default is 5432)
        DATABASE_PORT: 5432

        # Add the database name that mindwendel should use, e.g. in this case we created and named the database `mindwendel_prod`
        DATABASE_NAME: "mindwendel_prod"

        # Add the credentials for the database user that mindwendel should use to access the database
        # NOTE: The database user should have read and write permissions
        DATABASE_USER: "mindwendel_db_user"
        DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD: "mindwendel_db_user_password"

        # Add the url host that points to this mindwendel installation. This is used by mindwendel to generate urls with the right host throughout the app.
        URL_HOST: "your_domain_to_mindwendel"
        URL_PORT: 80

        # for non local setups, ssl should be set to true!
        DATABASE_SSL: "false"
        MW_DEFAULT_LOCALE: en

        # Add a secret key base for mindwendel for encrypting the use session
        # NOTE: There are multiple commands you can use to generate a secret key base. Pick one command you like, e.g.:
        # `date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 64 ; echo`
        # See https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/30184/10-ways-to-generate-a-random-password-from-the-command-line/
        SECRET_KEY_BASE: "generate_your_own_secret_key_base_and_save_it"
      ports:
        - "80:4000"
      depends_on:
        - db

    # If you do not have another postgres database service in this docker-compose, you can add this postgres service.
    # Note: Please use other credentials when using this in production.
    db:
      image: postgres:latest
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
      restart: always
      ports:
        - "5432:5432"
      # This is important for a production setup in order ot presist the mindwendel database even the docker container is stopped and removed
      volumes:
        - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumes:
    pgdata:
  ```

- To run mindwendel via Docker-Compose, just type

  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

- To create the production database (after having created the containers via up):

  First, start the container:

  ```sh
  docker start mindwendel_db_1
  ```

  Then eiher:

  ```sh
  docker exec -it mindwendel_db_1 createuser -rPed mindwendel_db_user --username=postgres
  docker exec -it mindwendel_db_1 createdb mindwendel_prod --username=mindwendel_db_user
  ```

  Or login to the container and do it from there:

  ```sh
  docker exec -it mindwendel_db_1 sh
  su -- postgres
  psql
  postgres=# CREATE USER mindwendel_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'mindwendel_db_user_password';
  postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mindwendel_prod;
  postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mindwendel_prod TO mindwendel_db_user;
  \q
  exit
  ```

  After that, adjust the db password in the docker compose file accordingly.

  Note: Adjust the env vars in `docker-compose.yml` according to your preferences.

## Running on Docker

If you are using Docker containers and prefer to manage your mindwendel installation that way then weâ€™ve got you covered. This guide discusses how to use the mindwendel docker image to launch a container running mindwendel.

- Run mindwendel via [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) (without postgres database)
  ```sh
  docker run -d --name mindwendel \
    -p 127.0.0.1:80:4000 \
    -e DATABASE_HOST="..." \
    -e DATABASE_PORT="5432" \
    -e DATABASE_SSL="false" \
    -e DATABASE_NAME="mindwendel_prod" \
    -e DATABASE_USER="mindwendel_db_user" \
    -e DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD="mindwendel_db_user_password" \
    -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="generate_your_own_secret_key_base_and_save_it" \
    -e URL_HOST="your_domain_to_mindwendel" \
    ghcr.io/mindwendel/mindwendel
  ```

NOTE: mindwendel requires a postgres database. You can use our docker-compose file to also install the postgres, see [above](#running-on-docker-compose).

## Running on Gigalixir.com

Gigalixir.com is a plattform as a service that fully supports Elixir and Phoenix.

Follow the steps as described in [this guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/gigalixir.html#content).

Note: Because of the releases.exs, Gigalixir automatically deploys the app as an elixir release. This is why `gigalixir run mix ecto.migrate` will not work. However, the Gigalixir team provides another utility command that helps with the migration `gigalixir ps:migrate`, see https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html#how-to-run-migrations .
