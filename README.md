## Use-cases

Brainstorm ...

- ... new business ideas
- ... solutions for a problem
- ... what to eat tonight
- ...

## Getting Started

mindwendel can be run just about anywhere. So checkout our [Installation Guides](./docs/installing_mindwendel.md) for detailed instructions for various deployments.

Here's the TLDR:

- Run mindwendel via Docker and reference your postgres database

  ```sh
  docker run -d --name mindwendel \
    -p 127.0.0.1:80:4000 \
    -e DATABASE_HOST="..." \
    -e DATABASE_PORT="5432" \
    -e DATABASE_NAME="mindwendel_prod" \
    -e DATABASE_USER="mindwendel_db_user" \
    -e DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD="mindwendel_db_user_password" \
    -e SECRET_KEY_BASE="generate_your_own_secret_key_base_and_save_it" \
    -e URL_HOST="your_domain_to_mindwendel" \
    ghcr.io/mindwendel/mindwendel
  ```

NOTE: mindwendel requires a postgres database. You can use [our docker-compose file](./docs/installing_mindwendel.md#running-on-docker-compose) to also install the postgres.

## Usage example

## Contributing

To get started with a development installation of mindwendel, follow the instructions below.

mindwendel is built on top of:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [Phoenix Framework](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix)
- [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

### Dev setup based on Docker

- Startup docker container
  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```
- Go to http://localhost:4000/

- Open you favorite editor and start developing

- Open a shell in the docker container to execute tests, etc.

  ```sh
  docker exec -it mindwendel sh
  ```

- In the shell, you can now execute all commands as on you local machine, see [testing commands](#testing)

### Dev setup an your local machine (without docker)

- Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/mindwendel/mindwendel.git
  ```
- Install dependencies with
  ```sh
  mix deps.get
  ```
- Copy and adjust local env variables, e.g. DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_NAME, etc.
  ```sh
  cp .env.default .env
  ```
- Load your env variables; NOTE: Always do this when your env settings change or your open a new terminal session
  ```sh
  source .env
  ```
- Create and migrate your database with
  ```sh
  mix ecto.setup
  ```
- Add seeds with
  ```sh
  mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
  ```
- Install NPM packages
  ```sh
  npm --prefix assets install
  ```
- Start the phoenix server
  ```sh
  mix phx.server
  ```
- Go to http://localhost:4000/

### Testing

- Load the env variables for testing
  ```sh
  source .env
  ```
- Ensure your database is running and reset your database
  ```sh
  MIX_ENV=test mix ecto.reset
  ```
- Run the test
  ```sh
  mix test
  ```

### Build release and production docker image

- Build the docker image based on our Dockerfile
  ```sh
  docker build -t mindwendel_prod .
  ```

### Formatting

We are using Elixir's built-in formatter.

- Check if the code is properly formatted
  ```sh
  mix format --check-formatted
  ```
- Automatically format the code
  ```sh
  mix format
  ```

## Environment Variables

### Localisation

You can extract new strings to translate by running:

```
 mix gettext.extract --merge
```
